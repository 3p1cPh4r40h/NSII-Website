        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Our mission is to create a multi-disciplinary Think Tank that inspires, educates, and supports the next
            generation of thinkers and innovators.

            We are committed to providing a platform that encourages creativity, collaboration, and the exchange of
            ideas across diverse backgrounds and skillsets. Our goal is to empower students, to develop and pursue their
            passions through exciting projects and competitions that challenge them to think critically and push the
            boundaries of what is possible.

            Through our work, we aim to inspire and equip the next generation of leaders and changemakers who will shape
            the future of our world. We are committed to making a positive impact on our community and the world at
            large, and together, we have the power to make a real difference and create lasting change.

                    of 2022.
                    The team consisted of Neel Shah (Team Lead), Benjamin D. Fedoruk (Team Manager), Isaac Bahler,
                    Russell Frost and Samantha Chong.
                    Although the team did not win any prizes, a strong solution was posed. The team proposed Mjolnir, a
                    service for nuclear energy companies
                    to improve the likelihood of IAA approval by leveraging sentiment analytic insights..</p>
