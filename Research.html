				<p class="research-details">
					NSII competed in the Catalyst Challenge: CleanTech Coast-to-Coast in August of 2022. 
					The team consisted of Neel Shah (Team Lead), Benjamin D. Fedoruk (Team Manager), Isaac Bahler, Russell Frost and Samantha Chong. 
					Although the team did not win any prizes, a strong solution was posed. The team proposed Mjolnir, a service for nuclear energy companies 
					to improve the likelihood of IAA approval by leveraging sentiment analytic insights.

					<p class="research-details">
						NSII submitted two teams to the 2022 REO Blueprint Competition, hosted by STEM Fellowship. 
						Results are currently pending. On one team, Isaac Bahler and Russell Frost used a multimodal sentiment analysis system 
						to eliminate climate change deniers and to distribute materials over social media. The other team, Samantha B. Chong 
						and Jason Thai used statistical models to predict the optimal crop for environmental and sustainable growth.

				<p class="research-details">
					A team from NSII competed in the STEM Fellowship's York Indicium Research Competition. The team, consisting of Benjamin 
					Fedoruk, Neel Shah and Amanda Showler, created a poster along with mentor Dr. Peiying (Jennifer) Tsai. Our research, Titled
					 Darwinian MAVs: The Biomimicry of a Hybridization of Small Birds' Flight Patterns in the UAV Context, proposes an 
					 abstraction and hybridization approach to ornithopter-type micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) design. Darwinian evolution and 
					 Survival of the Fittest ensures that nature is well-designed. Thus, when designing MAVs, it is advisable to mimic natural 
					 patterns under specific use cases. Although the team did not win the competition, we plan on continuing our research and 
					 presenting at a conference.

				<p class="research-details">
					NSII participated in the 2021 IBM DataJam Against Exploitation in May 2021. Although the team did not place in the top 3, we were
					 happy to participate. We worked to create a series of genera discussing various policies to fight human trafficking, while taking 
					 into account that various jurisdictions will have differing optima/requirements. This realization was achieved using various data
					  analysis, which produced an optimal freedom score for minimizing human trafficking.
